title: They look cool but, numerical TLDs don't work

While creating websites and certs for all the Handshake TLDs in our portfolio, I came to an unfortunate realization...none of the numerical TLDs resolved. At least, not in the way I expected them to.

| URL               | Resolves     |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| `https://0451/`   | `0.0.1.41`   |
| `https://0x01/`   | `0.0.0.1`    |
| `https://0xa0/`   | `0.0.0.160`  |
| `https://2077/`   | `0.0.8.29`   |
| `https://247366/` | `0.3.198.70` |

TLDs with at least one ASCII character in them resolves: [07d0eb](https://07d0eb/ "link to the splash page for '07d0eb'"), [2oo](https://2oo/ "link to the splash page for '2oo'"), [5oo](https://5oo/ "link to the splash page for '5oo'"), and [50p](https://50p/ "link to the splash page for '50p'") are fine. You may be thinking, "but wait, 0x01 and 0xa0 fit that criteria!" Well, not exactly.

Numbers (or, literals) that start with `0x` are hexidecimal integers. `0x01` has a decimal value of `1` while `0xa0` translates to a non-breaking space in Unicode. Basically, computers already use these symbols for more important tasks than giving us cool-looking TLDs to sell SLDs on.

From the perspective of browser/web server resolution, numerical TLDs are worthless because they're unreachable and therefore unusable.

From the perspectives of identity, community, and decentralized logins...they're intriguing.

Using `10000/` as an example, let's say it's a community of just 10,000 people. Every SLD is a number ranging from 1-10,000. Maybe they have an olde web domain like `10000.club`, to facilitate events. `#.10000/` could be their NFT membership proof for exclusive or behind-the-scenes access, whatever.

`0451` is the code for the first security door you access in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. `2077` is in the title for Cyberpunk 2077, `247366` is "every day plus leap year" (also, someone else snagged `247365`). Time will tell if there's a market for these but if nothing else, Eidos Montreal and CD Projekt Red are welcome to claim the names inspired by their games.

## 2022.06.13 update

The owner of `247/`, [@Chaindomains3](https://twitter.com/Chaindomains3 "@Chaindomains3 on Twitter"), contacted me to inquire about existing domains sold on his TLD. Are those domains doomed? _Not quite_.

Using `casino.247/` as an example, it currently only resolves in Firefox. Safari will refuse to resolve and Chromium assumes you want to search (as in, it doesn't recognize it as a valid URL either). Firefox tends to eventually follow in the footsteps of the other two major browsers so who knows how long resolution will persist.
